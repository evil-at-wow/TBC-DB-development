## TBC-DB development

This is my collection of fixes and improvements for [TBC-DB](http://udb.no-ip.org/index.php#c94),
a content database for [CMaNGOS/mangos-tbc](https://github.com/cmangos/mangos-tbc).

They are intended for people familiar with using, installing and updating TBC-DB or similar content
databases. A correct TBC-DB installation is a prerequisite, because TBC-DB itself is **not**
part of this repository. The changes can be installed as if they were a TBC-DB update pack,
i.e. you have to apply them to your *mangos* database.

You are hereby invited to review and/or test the changes, and provide feedback as a line note
in commits or as an issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/evil-at-wow/TBC-DB-development/issues). 

It is important to understand that my changes can not be supported by the TBC-DB team before
they are actually part of an official TBC-DB release, so please don't bother them with any
issues introduced by installing any of my changes. I work together with the TBC-DB team, so the
changes might end up in a future TBC-DB version, but there are **no** guarantees. Treat the
changes here as custom content, and use them at your own risk!
